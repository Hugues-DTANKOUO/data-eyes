# Data-eyes

Welcome to the **Data-eyes** repository! This project is part of a learning journey in Python, designed to help you master data manipulation while creating a practical tool for handling tabular data. Here, you’ll build a web interface to work with structured data files and generate SQL queries, all while keeping things simple and useful.

---

## 📚 **Project Overview**

**Data-eyes** empowers you to:  
- Load and explore tabular data from CSV and JSON files.  
- Filter, sort, and analyze data through an intuitive web interface.  
- Generate SQL queries based on your actions, exportable for real-world use.  

This is a hands-on project to strengthen your Python skills and provide a lightweight alternative to costly business intelligence tools, especially valuable in resource-constrained environments.

## ⚙️ **Current Implementation**

1. **Data Handling:**  
   - Processes CSV and JSON files using Python’s built-in modules.  
   - Displays data in a tabular format with basic filtering and sorting capabilities.  

2. **Web Interface:**  
   - Built with FastAPI for the backend and Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML.  
   - Markdown descriptions rendered with Markdown-it on the frontend.  

3. **SQL Generation:**  
   - Translates user actions into SQL queries, stored for export or reuse.

## 🚧 **Project Status**

*Data-eyes* is in its early stages, with the core pieces already in place. Looking ahead, we might:  
- Add tools for summarizing data (like totals or averages).  
- Improve how we export queries and results.  
- Make the interface even smoother and more inviting.  

Your thoughts will help guide where we take it next!
